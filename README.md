## **Description:**  
Simple portfolio created with reusable-component approach. For the first time I am using SASS-MODULES binded with REACT-COMPONENTS and as for now it works fine :).

### **1.RWD: progressive enhancement approach**
Site is created for mobile view and I hardly use breakpoints (only for heksagon gallery). Looks good on each screen, however I plan to add more elements for weider screens.

### **2.Menu - I made smooth menu transiton using Promise and react-scroll package.**

### **3.Section Works displays hexagon gallery that adapts to different screen seizes.**

### **4.Contact form is conected to Firebase and has simple validation.**

### **5.2019- update and optimization LAZY LOAD, SERVICEWORKER, PWA, WEBP**

After more than a year I decided to update my portfolio project and optimize performance. I updated dependencies and made enhancemnts in accordance with Chrome devtools audit suggestions. I also made application available offline (PWA). All indicators are green. I think it is quite challenging to develop code that you haven't seen for a year. But it gives some hints how to write it in a KISS way, so that it easy to maintain it.
