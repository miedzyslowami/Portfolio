## **Description:**  
Simple portfolio created with reusable-component approach. For the first time I am using SASS-MODULES binded with REACT-COMPONENTS and as for now it works fine :).

1.RWD: progressive enhancement approach
Site is created for mobile view and I hardly use breakpoints (only for heksagon gallery). Looks good on each screen, however I plan to add more elements for weider screens.

2.Menu - I made smooth menu transiton using Promise and react-scroll package.

3.Section Works displays hexagon gallery that adapts to different screen seizes.

4.Contact form is conected to Firebase and has simple validation.
